 <p>Earlier this year we learned that a number of Councilors do not read their emails, additionally weâ€™ve learned that other members of Council are much more receptive to text messages or phone calls.  If you feel comfortable doing so please let them know about the issues you care about in our city.  Like the pre-populated emails above, simply click the link, make any adjustments you'd like, sign it at the bottom and then hit send!</p>
 <p>p.s. If you have an Android device tap "Android Text" and if you have an iOS device tap "iOS Text".  Still working on cleaning this up :)</p>
