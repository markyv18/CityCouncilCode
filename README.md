# CityCouncilCode
random smattering of HTML/CSS/JS code tools for scaling engagement with Boulder City Council 

There are two sets of tools in the file, one is an email concatenator for seeding emails to council instantly. 
Many constituents aren't ever sure where to begin when it comes to chatting with council. This tool automagically 
opens up their email client, populates the address field with all 9 councilor's contacts, adds a Subject line and 
seeds the body of the email with some sample text.

The second tool is similar to the first but allows the user to text individual members of council.  

Thoughts for future refinement. 
Add BCC field to the email tool.
Add ability to text all nine councilors via a single link. 
Fix the need for separate Android/iOS links.
